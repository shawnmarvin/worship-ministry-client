[Intro]

F   Am G     C/E    Am  G


[Verse 1]

  C                    F                 C
A thousand generations falling down in worship
   Am               G             F
To sing the song of ages to the Lamb
    C                             F               C
And all who've gone before us and all who will believe
     Am                G            F
Will sing the song of ages to the Lamb


[Pre-chorus]

     F                  Am
Your name is the highest
     G
Your name is the greatest
     Am                     F
Your name stands above them all
    F                    Am
All thrones and dominions
    G
All powers and positions
     Am                     Dm
Your name stands above them all


[Chorus]

                F      Am G
And the angels cry: "Ho-o-ly"
               C/E        Am
All creation cries: "Ho-o-ly"
                Dm        G
You are lifted high, ho-o-ly
          C    Csus4   C
Holy fore - ver


[Verse 2]

C                           F                C
If you've been forgiven and if you've been redeemed
Am               G             F
Sing the song forever to the Lamb
C                          F                 C
If you walk in freedom and if you bear His name
Am               G             F
Sing the song forever to the Lamb
      Am               G          F
We'll sing the song forever and amen


[Chorus 2]

                F      Am G
And the angels cry: "Ho-o-ly"
               C/E        Am
All creation cries: "Ho-o-ly"
                Dm        G
You are lifted high, ho-o-ly
          C    Csus4   C
Holy fore - ver
             C/E  F       Am G
Hear your people sing: "Ho-o-ly"
                C/E         Am
To the King of Kings: "Ho-o-ly"
                Dm      G
You will always be ho-o-ly
          C   Csus4   C
Holy fore - ver


[Pre-chorus 2]

     F                  Am

All thrones and dominions
    G
All powers and positions
     Am                     F
Your name stands above them all

            F                  Am
Jesus, Your name is the highest
     G
Your name is the greatest
     Am                     F
Your name stands above them all
    F                    Am
All thrones and dominions
    G
All powers and positions
     Am                     Dm
Your name stands above them all

And the angels cry: "Ho-o-ly"

All creation cries: "Ho-o-ly"
                Dm         G
You are lifted high: "Ho-o-ly"
          C    Csus4  C
Holy fore - ver
             C/E  F       Am G
Hear your people sing: "Ho-o-ly"
                C/E         Am
To the King of Kings: "Ho-o-ly"
                Dm      G
